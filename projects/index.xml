Next Anime Episode does one job: To help you keep track of airing anime and when they will have a new episode available in Japan.
Generally, sub based simulcast streaming services have the newest episodes available within one hour after they air in Japan.
Simply browse the currently airing chart, select which anime you are interested in, and you will receive a notification when a new episode for your selected series is available.</description>

<p>—- Friendly version —-</p>

<p>This app by itself does not collect any kind of information from your information at all. Not personal information, not analytics, or anything.
However, the app uses the Anilist.co service to retrieve anime. Your device does standard HTTP requests to this server. The information sent on HTTP requests usually include some information including IP address, user agents, and others.
By using Next Anime Episode, you agree that some information pertaining to HTTP requests will be sent to Anilist.co’s servers, and therefore you agree with their privacy policy. I am not associated with Anilist in any way.</p>
